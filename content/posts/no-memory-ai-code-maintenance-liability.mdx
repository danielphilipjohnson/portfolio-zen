We’ve all heard the hype. Clean code. Fast demos. Deadlines magically met. Features ship like clockwork. Until they don’t. What happens after the demo is done? After the pitch deck glow fades and the stakeholders log off?

**Maintenance begins.**

And that’s where things fall apart. Because the code might be syntactically correct—but semantically lost. Requirements shift. Business logic bends. A new integration surfaces some edge case no one ever considered. And suddenly, your AI-generated function is a haunted house of assumptions no one remembers making.

You’re not shipping features anymore. You’re not shipping features anymore. You’re **excavating** brittle abstractions—digging through code someone thought was helpful but never explained. No map. No memory. Just a maze of decisions with no trail.

Because here’s the part most AI evangelists skip: **AI can write code, but it doesn’t understand *why*.** And in engineering, the *why* isn’t a luxury—it’s everything.

It’s what lets someone join a team and make sense of the architecture.  
It’s what lets you debug an outage at 3 a.m. without first trying to channel the ghost of the last dev.  
It’s how we move fast *without* breaking everything.

## It Writes Code — But Not the Why

Let’s give AI its due: it slings syntax like a short-order cook—fast, clean, sometimes even elegant. It replicates patterns, closes brackets, follows best practices—often good enough to pass a pull request review.

But mimicry isn’t mastery. Flawlessly reproducing patterns isn't the same as understanding the principles *behind* them or the reasons certain practices evolved. Mastery involves grasping *why* one solution is chosen over countless others in a specific context—a depth of situational insight and reasoned judgement that statistical replication doesn't possess.

Code is not just syntax. It’s a reflection of messy business rules, evolving requirements, and years of hard-won, “why the hell did we do it *this* way?” decisions. And AI? It wasn’t there for any of it.

It didn’t sit in the planning meeting where Marketing rewrote the requirements—again. It didn’t argue over technical trade-offs under a deadline. It doesn’t understand the verbal patch you made to keep a legacy data contract alive.

## Systems Are Stories

Code is a story. Every line is shaped by conversations, user quirks, technical constraints—most of which never make it into documentation.

But humans leave trails. We create imperfect, essential memory:

* Pull request debates and war stories
    
* Slack threads with buried insight
    
* Jira tickets that explain the *why*, not just the *what*
    
* Cryptic-but-critical commit messages
    
* Desperate, blessed code comments: *“Dear future me…”*
    

This is how maintainability survives. Not in the syntax—but in the context.

AI-generated code offers no such memory. It’s like receiving a precisely machined engine part, delivered without a serial number, material specification, or performance test results: its tolerances are unknown, its stress limits untested, its role in the larger assembly a dangerous guess. Just a seemingly perfect solution until it shatters under operational strain.

## The Context Window Is Not Enough

AI models operate within narrow context windows. Even the most advanced ones don’t remember your planning meetings, your war-room debates, or that one bizarre constraint Legal demanded during a hallway chat. Those details aren’t in the repo. They’re in your head. In Slack. In timeboxed meetings. In decisions made under pressure—and never written down. And if the AI didn’t see them? It doesn’t know them. Worse, any context it was fed—say, the initial specs from a Jira ticket—can rapidly become outdated as requirements shift and discussions evolve. Unless someone meticulously re-briefs the AI with every single change, its understanding becomes a dangerously misleading snapshot of the past. So when it writes code, it’s not preserving your system’s story. It’s overwriting it—with silence.

**And silence doesn’t scale.**

## The Illusion of Help

AI feels fast—until it doesn’t. You describe the task, and out comes code. Neat! But then it doesn’t quite fit. So you clarify. Add edge cases. Paste old snippets. Rewrite the prompt. Again.

It starts to feel less like acceleration and more like stenography. You're feeding the machine what it needs—step by step—until eventually, it spits something back that looks vaguely right. But something unsettling happens along the way:

<Quote>
The more context you give it, the more obvious it becomes—you already *had* everything you needed to solve the problem.
</Quote>

The AI didn’t solve it. *You* did—piecemeal, in slow motion, while explaining it to a tool that can’t understand you.

The code? It just echoed back fragments of your own thinking.

What starts as collaboration ends in recursion.You don’t save time. You just offload your clarity—into a black box that forgets everything the moment you close the tab.

**And that’s the real problem.**


## When Chat Becomes a Dead End

In a normal workflow, someone makes a decision—and leaves a trail. A Jira ticket. A commit message. A Slack thread. Even a lazy `“// TODO: Fix this later”` can be a breadcrumb.

But when you work with an AI? The initial spark of an idea, the core of a decision, lives within the transient space of a prompt. The code gets generated—but the nuanced human reasoning that guided it vanishes the moment you close the tab or scroll away.

And this is where the illusion of AI efficiency often shatters. Think about your interactions in tools like Cursor IDE, or any AI chat window. That entire conversational dance—the initial prompt, the back-and-forth clarifications, the AI’s suggestions you refined, the subtle pivots in your request—forms the *true* origin story of the code. Yet, this vital context is dangerously ephemeral. Close that chat, lose that session, or let the context window refresh, and that precise line of reasoning, that specific evolutionary path of the prompt, is often gone. *Forever*. Not archived, not versioned alongside the code, just… gone.

This isn't like a buried Slack thread you might eventually unearth. In many current AI tools, this critical dialogue is simply not designed for the same persistence or traceability we demand for every other engineering artefact.

So, what are you left with? No version control for the prompt that *actually* generated the final accepted code. No searchable thread linking the iterative human-AI conversation to the resulting logic. No reliable audit trail for a significant part of your creative process.

Just a block of working code, utterly severed from the iterative, context-rich dialogue that birthed it. When that chat history evaporates—and it so often does—the *why* evaporates with it. No one can trace a bug back to a design choice explored only in that fleeting AI chat. No one can reconstruct the full intent behind a feature that was incrementally coaxed out of a series of prompts. You’re not debugging a system—you’re reverse-engineering a ghost.


## When It Breaks, It Breaks Hard

You know the moment. Tuesday morning. 9:47 a.m. Slack’s on fire. Prod’s down. CEO’s typing. Everyone’s pretending to stay calm. You open the file. And there it is: a wall of perfectly formatted logic. It compiles. It runs. But no one knows what it’s doing—or why it’s there.

No comments No docs No breadcrumbs No memory Just a set of branching conditions that seem... haunted.

The questions come fast, **each one a testament to a context that vanished with a closed browser tab:**

* What was the *actual business problem* this prompt was truly meant to address?
    
* Why *this specific output* from the AI—what nuance in the prompt led to this now-inscrutable logic?
    
* What forgotten examples, constraints, or few-shot instructions fed to the AI shaped *this exact structure*?
    
* Who crafted that final, critical prompt, and what vital piece of their human understanding evaporated when the AI chat session ended?

Spoiler: it came from a prompt. A one-off test. A forgotten tab. The dev’s gone. The context? Deleted before it ever hit Git. And now it’s your job to make sense of it.

## Ghost Code, Haunted Teams

This is the risk. Code stitched by AI. Shipped under pressure. Prompt long forgotten. No context. No history. No human connection to the decision.

**Code written by a ghost, for a problem no one remembers.** That’s not engineering. That’s séance work.
</Quote>

Here’s what it looks like in the wild:

<CodeBlock language="javascript">
{`
// Function to determine eligibility and process user data
// AI-generated, deployed last quarter. Author: AI_CodeBot_v2.3
// Original prompt: "Create function for user processing based on level and flags."

function handleUserProcessing(userId, accessLevel, internalFlagsBundle) {
    // Assuming these functions exist and userData/config are objects:
    const userData = fetchUserDetails(userId); 
    const config = loadSystemConfig();

    const paramAlpha = config.getParam("alpha_threshold", 0.75); // Or config.alpha_threshold || 0.75;
    const featureXActive = internalFlagsBundle.checkFlag("FEATURE_X_MODE");

    let result;

    if (accessLevel >= 5 || (userData.is_legacy_user && featureXActive)) {
        if ((userData.score || 0) > paramAlpha * 100) {
            // In JS, named params are often passed as an object
            result = processEnhancedPath(userData, { keySetting: "val_AY4" });
        } else {
            result = processStandardPathB(userData, { timeoutMs: 500 });
        }
    } else if (accessLevel === 4 && !featureXActive) {
        result = processPathC(userData, { deprecatedParam: "legacy_setting_7" });
    } else {
        result = processDefaultPath(userData);
    }

    // Assuming result object has statusCode and payload properties
    logProcessingEvent(userId, result.statusCode); 
    return result.payload;
}`}
</CodeBlock>


Everything *works*—until it doesn’t.

And then you're left asking:

* Why `paramAlpha * 100`?
    
* What does `"val_AY4"` mean?
    
* Why does `FEATURE_X_MODE` affect legacy users?
    
* What’s `legacy_setting_7`?
    
* What happens if we remove `processPathC`?
    

None of it is in the code. None of it is documented. It lived in a prompt. In someone’s head. Maybe in Slack.

**Now it’s your problem.**

## The Real Cost of Contextless Code

This isn’t an anti-AI crusade. The tools are impressive. They generate syntax, accelerate tasks, and mimic patterns well enough to fool a pull request reviewer. That’s not the issue.

The issue is pretending that mimicry is understanding.

When you let AI generate code without guarding the context behind it, you’re not building software—you’re assembling puzzles you don’t even know exist until production breaks. And when it does, you won’t find a neatly written spec or a Slack thread with the rationale. You’ll find a black box. A blank space where memory was supposed to be.

AI doesn’t know your business logic. It wasn’t there when the feature was pitched, revised, rewritten, and hacked together hours before launch. It doesn’t understand the trade-offs made under pressure, or the weird legacy system you kept alive for one client on an old plan who still writes in to support once a week.

It knows how to autocomplete a function. It doesn’t know how to carry a system.

And that’s the trade. You’ll get speed. You’ll get clean syntax. But you won’t get the why. You won’t get the trail. You won’t get someone who remembers what broke three quarters ago and how you duct-taped it into shape just long enough to pass QA.

So yes, let the AI write the code. But be ready.

Because when something finally goes wrong—and it will—you won’t just be debugging.  
You’ll be summoning context from the dead.  
You’ll be holding a [séance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9ance).

## So What Do We Do?

This isn't a rejection of AI, but rather a crucial reminder for how we must operate: while AI can indeed generate code with impressive efficiency, it's human engineers who are ultimately responsible for building and maintaining coherent, understandable systems. Therefore, if you integrate AI into your development workflow, the onus is on you to meticulously document the 'why,' archive the specific prompts that yielded the code, capture the essential back-and-forth dialogue, and version this entire contextual rationale with the same diligence you apply to the code itself. Neglect these practices, and the outcome is stark: you won't merely be losing pieces of context—you'll be actively constructing the haunted systems of tomorrow.
