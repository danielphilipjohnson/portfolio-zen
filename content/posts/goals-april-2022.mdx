*In this post I've listed all my goals for 2022. After the success of last years, more than I could have ever imagined. I've decided to make another.*

## Revamp my website

At the end of last year, I started to migrate my website from Gatsby.js to Nuxt.js.  
The reason for this was to have a website with my current Tech Stack. I grew tired of updating markdown files and committing them to GitHub. I wanted to move to a JavaScript Content Management System.

After some research and attending a conference with my good friend Alba, I decided on **Storyblok**.

The migration started very slow. I did not make the progress I hoped.  
So this year I want to fully migrate my website and implement new features that allow me to blog much quicker.

**A list of things I wish to add:**
- Make a new mobile nav
- Use my skills I learnt from [Web Performance Fundamentals](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-perf/)
- Make individual project pages to demonstrate my portfolio work
- Dark mode
- Update my contact form to allow more personal feedback
- Learn about Google Tag Manager and use it on my website
- Create sections on the blog page to display my reflection and tech blogs

## Become a Better Developer

To become a better developer I've planned to improve the following:

**Continue to expand coding knowledge:**  
I want to improve my flexibility with writing code. I want to become knowledgeable in many different languages. I want to use **Go** more and build some cool microservices.  
Understanding many programming languages gives a deeper understanding of different solutions.

**Know-How To Plan My Tasks Better:**  
Be able to successfully break big tasks into small chunks and give better time estimates for project completion.

**Know-How To Communicate Well with Others:**  
Teams build excellent products, so I will focus on improving communication and pursuing public speaking.

**See The Bigger Picture:**  
Instead of laser-focusing on a single task, I want to expand my mind and look at the real, longer-term problem.

**Prioritizing What Matters Most:**  
By tracking my time better, I can improve productivity and have a positive impact.

**Understand That All Solutions Are Not Equal:**  
Evaluate the solutions instead of rushing to the first one.

**Keeping It Simple:**  
Readability is more important than cleverness. I want to focus on writing clean, simple code.

**Know-How To Build and Break Stuff:**  
Breaking things teaches valuable lessons. I plan to play more with Nuxt 3 and contribute to open-source.

**Learn To Take Issues To The Chin:**  
I need to admit mistakes without letting them affect my confidence.

**Stay Humble:**  
Stay level-headed, continue learning, and focus on listening better.

## I've Created a Reading List

Last year, I read a book a week. This year, I plan to do the same.

**Books to read:**
- *Code Craft*
- *Effective Debugging*
- *Understanding Software*
- *Software Architect's Handbook*
- *Professional Git*
- *Seriously Good Software*
- *Kanban in Action*
- *Street Coder*
- *Beginning Software Engineering*
- *Time Management*
- *Project Management Basics*

## Build Projects

I plan to:
- Build a **Nuxt 3 and Prismic blog**, converting my old Gatsby 2 React project.
- Integrate **Prismic with BigCommerce** (maybe with a mini Amazon clone).
- Build an **Invoice FullStack application** using Prisma, Next.js, TypeScript, and Nuxt.

## Improved My Skills with Algorithm and Code Challenges

I'm planning to spend weekends on data structures and algorithms.

**Videos to study:**
- [Dynamic Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk)
- [Graph Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWVWeAqZ0WU)
- [Binary Tree Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAAZixBzIAI)
- [Recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJDJ0kBx2LM)

I want to finally finish my **HackerRank** progress: [My Profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/daniel_p_johnson?hr_r=1)

I aim to:
- Finish *Problem Solving* challenges
- Start the *HackerRank Interview Preparation Kit*
- Take certifications:
  - JavaScript (Intermediate) Skills Certification Test
  - Rest API (Intermediate) Skills Certification Test

I also want to complete: [Master the Coding Interview: Big Tech (FAANG) Interviews](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-big-tech-faang-interviews/)

## Commit to Content Creation and Blogging More Frequently

I'm going to start documenting my learning and release a blog every month.  
Eventually, I want to commit to a regular publishing schedule.

I also plan to make tutorials and turn them into **YouTube videos**.

## Continue to Master My Tech Stack

When I was offered a FullStack developer role, I had to learn a whole new tech stack.  
In six months, I moved from React.js to:

- Tailwind CSS
- Nuxt.js
- TypeScript

On the CMS side:
- Prismic
- Storyblok
- WordPress

Integrated often with:
- Stripe
- Firebase

Backend experience:
- Legacy projects with Python and Django REST
- Moving towards a Node.js-based backend (hopefully Nest.js 😍)

> **"Mastery is something that rarely happens. I just want to be more proficient with these frameworks, libraries, and languages."**

### In Summary

- Gain a better understanding of Vue and Nuxt
- Improve my TypeScript skills
- Become a master in Firebase
- Master Stripe
- Master Prismic
- Focus more on AWS (I have mostly worked with Netlify)
