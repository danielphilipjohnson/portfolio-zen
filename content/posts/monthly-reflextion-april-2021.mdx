# Don’t Rob Yourself of the Eureka: How AI Is Killing the Joy of Being a Developer

We were sold a lie.

Artificial intelligence was supposed to save us time. Eliminate the repetitive parts of our jobs. Automate the boring. Free us to focus on the interesting, the creative, the hard-but-worth-it stuff.

Instead, it’s flattening the craft. Speeding everything up, yes. But also stripping out the satisfaction. The part where we grow. The part where we learn. The part where we feel anything at all.

And for developers like me, who once found joy in the struggle, it’s starting to feel like something important is being quietly taken away.

## The Puzzle Isn’t the Problem—It’s the Point

I was playing *The Blue Prince* the other night. It’s a puzzle game. Strange, delicate, one of those games where the world reveals itself slowly if you just keep thinking.

I got stuck. And before I could ask for help, someone next to me blurted out the answer.

I didn’t ask. I didn’t want it. But just like that, the puzzle was solved.

Except it wasn’t.

The solution was on the screen, but the moment? Gone. No payoff. No joy. Just progress with none of the pride.

Later, I got stuck again. This time, I reached for Google. I almost hit enter. Then I paused. Remembered the feeling. Stepped away. Five minutes later, the answer came to me.

That was the high.

That click—when it’s your own—is everything.

## AI Doesn’t Just Fix Code. It Fixes Thinking—Badly

Now think about what it feels like to hit a wall while coding. A tricky bug. A state issue. Some function that refuses to behave. What do we do?

We paste it into ChatGPT.

It feels smart. Efficient. Productive. And sure, sometimes it gives you a useful hint.

But too often, it gives you *the answer*. And just like in the game, the moment dies.

No reasoning. No mental model. Just paste-and-pray. Move on.

The worst part? It starts to rewire how you approach problems. Instead of pausing, you prompt. Instead of debugging, you delegate. Your brain never gets to do the work—and so it stops learning how.

## ADHD and the Curse of Never Stepping Away

For someone like me, who lives with ADHD, this is especially brutal.

AI tools trap you in the loop. You get stuck, and instead of stepping away—letting your brain breathe, letting the insight simmer—you double down. Prompt again. Tweak the phrasing. Try another variation.

You never leave the problem. You never ruminate. You never rest.

And ironically, that space? That’s where breakthroughs happen.

I’ve had more "aha" moments making tea than while staring at VS Code. But with AI, I never get up. It keeps you locked in the hyperfocus. Addicted to the dopamine of near-solutions.

## Fixing the Surface, Missing the Root

I saw this in a PR recently. Someone made a field optional to stop a Sentry error. Quick AI-generated fix. Seemed fine.

Except upstream, the object was broken. The data wasn't being augmented at all.

The AI helped mask the error, not solve it. And because it looked clean, no one questioned it—until we hit another issue later that forced us to unpick the whole thing.

It wasn’t just a bad fix. It was a shortcut through what should’ve been a learning moment.

## The Cult of Speed is Starving the Craft

There’s a mindset shift happening. A cultural rewiring. AI makes things faster, so we’re starting to believe faster = better. That hesitation is waste. That struggle is inefficiency.

But that’s bullshit.

Thinking takes time. Understanding takes time. And growth takes *work*.

You don’t get better by copying answers. You get better by solving your own puzzles.

## Let AI Handle the Boring. Keep the Thinking for Yourself.

I’m not anti-AI. I use it. I like it. I think it can be brilliant at offloading the tedious stuff. Boilerplate code. Regex. Renaming variables. Writing tests you were going to write anyway.

But I’m learning to draw a line.

When I hit something tricky, I pause. I walk. I think. I give myself a chance.

Because when I figure it out on my own—even if it takes longer—I actually remember it. I actually *own* it.

That’s the job. That’s the joy. That’s what I signed up for.

Don’t let AI rob you of the eureka.

Let it clean up the scraps. But keep the soul of your work human.
