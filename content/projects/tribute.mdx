description: "I wanted the colours to reflect Juice Wrld posthumous album 'Legends Never Die. For the website, I included youtube iFrame linking to top songs from the album. Then I used Spotify embed and blended them into the website. I decided to use only vanilla CSS, test my knowledge of flex and grid for the layout and to make it fully responsive on all devices."
