								Span a few years to one year before I started college. I needed to
								buy a PC to submit my assignments. So during the summer of 2008, I
								worked so hard cleaning hotels with my mother. I now had enough
								money to buy my first computer a <ExternalLink href="https://www.mrmemory.co.uk/memory-ram-upgrades/packard-bell/imedia/x2414">
									Packard Bell iMedia x2414
								</ExternalLink> with an enormous amount of Ram totalling 2GB and an intel Celeron
								with duo cores. The best part was it was running everyone&apos;s
								favourite Windows version <ExternalLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista">
									Windows Vista
								</ExternalLink>.

							<Text variant="body" className="mb-4">
								It was so hard to get any work done. Then one fatal evening
								windows broke the <ExternalLink href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/69029855-21c1-411d-bdd3-b864222eefb6/dhcp-on-vista-has-stopped-running?forum=itprovistasetup">
									DHCP no longer worked
								</ExternalLink> I had no clue how to fix it and no other device to search how to fix
								it. I was then forced to use the library to find a solution get a
								windows disc this seemed almost impossible. I started to ask what is
								Windows and is there an alternative. The answer was Yes! <ExternalLink href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/JauntyJackalope">
									Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope)
								</ExternalLink>.

							<Text variant="body" className="mb-4">
								I encountered problems I was unable to download the ISO. So I
								asked canonical for a disc and enclosed a cheque to cover the
								shipping. From that day I have used Linux ever since. The distros I
								commonly use now are <ExternalLink href="https://kubuntu.org/">
									Kubuntu 20.10
								</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink href="https://manjaro.org/">
									Manjaro
								</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink href="https://archlinux.org/">
									Arch Linux
								</ExternalLink>. I use <ExternalLink href="https://kde.org/">
									KDE
								</ExternalLink> as my GUI &ldquo;you know what they say old habits die hard.&rdquo;

								Yes, I occasionally use Windows. After I built my next PC, I got
								<ExternalLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7">
									Windows 7
								</ExternalLink> and came across <ExternalLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA_Game_Studio">
									XNA Game Studio 3.0
								</ExternalLink>. The idea of making games for Xbox seemed great. It gave me a
								moment of nostalgia with my mom. Which lead me to learn C# from
								<ExternalLink href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/">
									Microsoft Academy
								</ExternalLink> and eventually built an <ExternalLink href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xnarpgtoolkit/">
									RPG game from the toolkit
								</ExternalLink> they provided.

							<Text variant="body">
								I progressed onto making an <ExternalLink href="https://ubuntu.com/server">
									Ubuntu Linux server
								</ExternalLink> out of interest as well as a samba server. All in my free time.
								During my final year of studies, I was responsible for creating
								experiments with python and using libraries such as <ExternalLink href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">
									pandas
								</ExternalLink>, <ExternalLink href="https://numpy.org/">
									NumPy
								</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink href="https://matplotlib.org/">

								development and love every moment I get using JavaScript and
